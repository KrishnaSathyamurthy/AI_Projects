# AI Project
Our team had worked on 3 projects over the course of the semester. The bot has to save the captain while escaping the aliens. But, will it though?  
The first project acts as a introduction to basic DSA concepts. We will be applying BFS/DFS and some novel methods to get the crew to the teleport cell while escaping the aliens.  
The second project helps us to understand the bayesian model and apply the concepts to help the crew save the captain while evading the aliens yet again.  
The third and final project uses Markov Decision Process to create a Value Iteration model to guide the captain towards the teleport cell. Later, we create an AI model (classification model) to learn from the Value Iteration model, and exploring how to improve the success rate through the process.
